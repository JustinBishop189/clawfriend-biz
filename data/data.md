| Average conversion rate (click→sign-up) | 1%–3% | [WebFX](https://www.webfx.com/blog/social-media/x-twitter-marketing-benchmarks/) | 2026 |

> **Status: RESOLVED in distribution-plan.md.** CPC has been updated to $1.50–2.00 (conservative baseline for Tech/Crypto vertical on X, sourced from [Marketing LTB 2025 benchmarks](https://marketingltb.com/blog/statistics/twitter-ads-statistics/)). At $1.75 avg CPC with $4,500 budget: ~2,571 clicks → **~68–90 direct sign-ups** at 3% conversion. **Brand awareness note added:** Twitter Ads also deliver 150K–300K impressions that build a warm retargeting pool — Month 2 retargeting of this pool converts at lower CPC than cold acquisition, improving total Twitter ROI beyond direct sign-ups.

### 6c. Crypto KOL / Influencer Rates (Twitter/X)

| Tier | Followers | Rate per post/thread | Source | Retrieved |
|------|-----------|---------------------|--------|-----------|
| Micro-KOL | 5K–20K | $100–$500 | [MediaX — crypto influencer costs](https://mediax.agency/blogs/crypto-influencer-marketing-cost) | 2025–2026 |
| Mid-tier KOL | 20K–100K | $500–$5,000 | [MediaX](https://mediax.agency/blogs/crypto-influencer-marketing-cost) | 2025–2026 |

| Platform avg (all niches, 2026) | — | $155/sponsored post | [Afluencer](https://afluencer.com/influencer-rates/) | 2026 |

> **Key implication:** The distribution plan budgets $2,500 for "1–2 creators with 10K–80K followers." A creator at 80K followers costs $500–$5,000 per post. $2,500 total = either 1 mid-tier creator at the lower end, or 5 micro-KOLs (5K–20K followers). The "50K–150K combined reach" target requires careful KOL selection.
