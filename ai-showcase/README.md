Add screenshots or links to **AI prompts** used for research (competitors, demand, distribution plan).

- Prompts for competitor research / feature comparison / user-count estimates
- Prompts for demand analysis: search volume, forums, competitor pricing
- Prompts for Distribution Plan: channel strategy, unit economics, timeline
- Workflow combining multiple tools: Claude + ChatGPT + Perplexity

**Note:** All numbers from AI must be verified against primary sources. Judges will ask “Where did this number come from?” — “From AI” is not an acceptable answer.
