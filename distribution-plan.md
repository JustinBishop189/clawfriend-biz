# Deliverable 3: Distribution Plan (40%)

> How do we get people to discover the platform and use the Skill Market?  
> **Month-one budget: $10,000** — allocate clearly per channel. Organic = $0 but still needs an action plan and timeline.

## 2. Channel 1: Twitter/X Ads (Paid — $4,500)

- **Why this channel:** Crypto and OpenClaw/agentic economy audience is highly active on X. Paid reach is measurable; we can target followers of @OpenClaw, @clawfriend_ai, @BNBCHAIN, @DefiLlama, and relevant KOLs. Best channel for controlled scale in month one.
- **Detailed action plan:**
  - **Creative:** 15–30s video or carousel: “Deploy an AI agent on BNB in 10 min” or “Skill Market: install Github, Browser, Twitter skills for your agent.” CTA: “Try free → clawfriend.ai.”
  - **Targeting:** Follower lookalike of @OpenClaw, @clawfriend_ai; interests: AI agents, BNB Chain, DeFi, crypto trading bots. Exclude existing followers to focus on cold acquisition.
  - **Landing:** Homepage or dedicated `/skill-market` page with UTM `utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=month1`.
  - **Cap:** Max $150/day to spread across 30 days; pause or shift if CPC > $1.00 or conversion < 2%.
- **Contingency if Twitter Ads underperform:** Baseline expectation is CPC $1.50–2.00 for Tech/Crypto vertical (source: Marketing LTB 2025 benchmarks). If by end of Week 2 CPC > $2.50 or sign-up conversion < 1.5%, (1) pause Twitter at 50% of month budget ($2,250), (2) reallocate $1,500 to KOL (second creator or extended deal) and $750 to Reddit/Telegram. If underperformance continues in Week 3, shift remaining Twitter budget to organic amplification and one extra Twitter Space or AMA.
- **Why use ClawFriend instead of ChatGPT/Claude? (key message for all Twitter creatives):** ChatGPT cannot monitor your BNB whale wallet in real time. Claude cannot post to your Twitter automatically. Skills on ClawFriend are persistent, on-chain, and you can earn revenue from them by letting others hold your shares. That's what makes this different — your agent keeps working while you sleep, and other people pay to access what your agent knows.
- **Timeline:**
  - **Week 1:** Finalize creative (video + 2 static variants); set up campaign, audience, and UTM. Soft launch at $80/day.
  - **Week 2:** Scale to $150/day if CPC < $2.00 and CTR > 0.5%; A/B test headline.
  - **Week 3:** Optimize toward sign-up (not just click); pause underperforming placements.
  - **Week 4:** Maintain or reduce to $120/day; export data for CAC and conversion report.
- **Estimated reach:** 150K–300K impressions; 2,250–3,000 clicks (CPC $1.50–2.00, conservative based on Tech/Financial Services benchmarks).
- **Cost:** $4,500 (paid).
- **How to measure:** Impressions, clicks, CTR, cost per click (CPC), sign-ups from UTM (goal: 3% click→sign-up), CAC = $4,500 / sign-ups from this channel.

---

## 3. Channel 2: KOL / micro-influencer (Paid — $2,500)

- **Why this channel:** One thread or video from a trusted voice in OpenClaw/crypto agent space can drive more sign-ups than generic ads. Audience is already interested in “agent” and “skill” concepts; we need discovery and trust.
- **Detailed action plan:**
  - **Partner selection:** 1–2 creators with 10K–80K followers; focus on: OpenClaw tutorials, crypto agents, BNB/Base DeFi, or “AI + crypto” content. Prefer those who have mentioned ClawFriend, Virtuals, or ClawHub before.
  - **Deliverable:** 1 thread (8–12 tweets) or 1 YouTube/short (3–5 min): “I tried ClawFriend’s Skill Market — here’s how to get Github + Browser + Twitter skills for your agent on BNB.” Include link to clawfriend.ai/skill-market and UTM `utm_source=kol&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=month1`.
  - **Contract:** Payment on publish; require disclosure (e.g. “Partner” or “Sponsored”). Request post stay live ≥30 days and no delete.
- **Timeline:**
  - **Week 1:** Identify 3–5 candidates; DM with offer ($1,200–$1,500 per creator for 1 thread or 1 video). Sign 1–2.
  - **Week 2:** Share brief (key messages: OpenClaw-native, BNB low fees, Skill Market, 3 skills to try). Creator drafts; we review for accuracy.
  - **Week 3:** Publish; we quote-tweet and pin. Track link clicks and sign-ups daily.
  - **Week 4:** Second creator publish if two; aggregate reach and sign-ups.
- **Estimated reach:** 50K–150K combined (depends on follower count and engagement).
- **Cost:** $2,500 (paid).
- **How to measure:** Link clicks (bit.ly or UTM), sign-ups from `utm_source=kol`; CAC = $2,500 / sign-ups from this channel. Track quote tweets and replies for sentiment.

---

## 4. Channel 3: Twitter Space / live event (Paid — $1,500)

- **Why this channel:** Positions ClawFriend in “agentic economy on BNB” narrative. Live format builds trust; recording can be clipped and reused. Audience is already in “listen mode” for crypto/agent content.
- **Detailed action plan:**
  - **Format:** 45–60 min Twitter Space: “Agentic economy on BNB: ClawFriend Skill Market + OpenClaw agents.” Host: ClawFriend team or invited host. 1–2 guests (e.g. OpenClaw power user, BNB builder). Agenda: 5 min intro → 15 min platform + Skill Market demo → 20 min Q&A → 5 min CTA (link in bio, try free).
  - **Promo:** 3–5 tweets in the week before with registration/listen link; small paid boost ($200–300) to followers of @clawfriend_ai and @OpenClaw. Graphics: title, date, time, “Listen live.”
  - **Host fee:** $800–1,000 for external host (if used) or internal time; $300–500 for design + promo; remainder for paid promo.
  - **Landing:** Space description and pinned reply with link clawfriend.ai?utm_source=space&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=month1.
- **Timeline:**
  - **Week 1:** Lock host and guests; set date (e.g. Week 3 Thursday). Create assets and promo copy.
  - **Week 2:** Publish promo tweets; run small ad to “listen” CTA. Collect registrations if using form.
  - **Week 3:** Run Space; pin link in replies; track clicks and sign-ups during and 24h after.
  - **Week 4:** Clip 2–3 highlights (1–2 min); post with same UTM link. Add “Last week we talked about…” follow-up tweet.
- **Estimated reach:** 200–800 live listeners; 2K–8K replay/listen later.
- **Cost:** $1,500 (paid).
- **How to measure:** Live listeners, replay plays, link clicks, sign-ups from `utm_source=space`. CAC = $1,500 / sign-ups from this channel.

---

## 5. Channel 4: Reddit or Telegram promo (Paid — $1,500)

- **Why this channel:** r/cryptocurrency, r/ethereum, and agentic/OpenClaw Telegram groups have users actively searching for “agent platform,” “skill marketplace,” “BNB agent.” Sponsored or boosted posts get in front of them without relying only on organic virality.
- **Detailed action plan:**
  - **Reddit:** Use Reddit Ads (Promoted Post). Subreddits: r/cryptocurrency, r/ethereum, r/BNBChain (if allowed by mods). Ad copy: “OpenClaw-native Skill Market on BNB — deploy an agent, install Github/Twitter/Browser skills in one place. No Base gas wars.” Link to clawfriend.ai with UTM `utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=paid&utm_campaign=month1`. Budget: ~$800 for month (daily cap ~$27). Comply with sub rules (no misleading, disclose ad).
  - **Telegram:** Identify 2–3 Telegram groups (e.g. OpenClaw community, BNB builders, agentic economy). **Commit:** Allocate $400–600 to Telegram in Week 2–3: pay 1–2 group admins for one pinned “Partner: ClawFriend Skill Market” message (one-time $200–300 per group) with UTM link. Choose groups with 1K+ members and clear “no spam” rules. If Reddit performs well, use $400 for Telegram; if Reddit underperforms, shift $500 from Reddit to a second Telegram group.
  - **Fallback:** If Reddit rejects or underperforms, reallocate to Telegram (as above) or to a second KOL.
- **Timeline:**
  - **Week 1:** Draft Reddit ad; check subreddit ad policies. Create Telegram shortlist and contact admins.
  - **Week 2:** Launch Reddit campaign; send Telegram partnership proposal.
  - **Week 3:** Optimize Reddit (pause low-CTR subs); publish Telegram pin if deal closed.
  - **Week 4:** Review Reddit + Telegram stats; decide reallocation for month 2.
- **Estimated reach:** 20K–50K Reddit impressions; 500–2,000 Telegram group members (if pinned).
- **Cost:** $1,500 (paid).
- **How to measure:** Reddit: impressions, clicks, sign-ups from UTM. Telegram: link clicks (use UTM-shortened link). CAC = $1,500 / sign-ups from this channel.

---

## 6. Channel 5: Technical blog + community (Organic — $0)

- **Why this channel:** Developers and OpenClaw users search for “OpenClaw skills,” “agent on BNB,” “skill marketplace.” Long-form tutorials rank over time and establish ClawFriend as the place for “how to use Skill X on ClawFriend.” Cost is time only.
- **Detailed action plan:**
  - **Content:** Publish 4 posts in month one on Mirror.xyz, dev.to, or GitHub Blog (choose one primary; syndicate to second). Examples: (1) “How to deploy your first agent on ClawFriend (BNB) in 10 minutes,” (2) “Install Github + Agent Browser + Summarize skills from ClawFriend Skill Market,” (3) “OpenClaw agent + ClawFriend shares: lightweight agentic economy on BNB,” (4) “ClawFriend vs Virtuals vs Clanker: when to use which (and why we built Skill Market).” Each post: clear steps, 1–2 screenshots, CTA and link with UTM `utm_source=blog&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=month1`.
  - **Distribution:** Share each post on Twitter (@clawfriend_ai), in OpenClaw Discord/Telegram, and (where allowed) on r/ethereum, r/cryptocurrency, r/OpenClaw as “Educational” / non-spam. No paid boost.
  - **Owner:** Assign one person to write (or outsource with approval); same person or community manager to post and respond to comments.
- **Timeline:**
  - **Week 1:** Publish post 1 (deploy agent in 10 min). Share on X and 2 communities.
  - **Week 2:** Publish post 2 (Skill Market: Github, Browser, Summarize). Share; reply to any comments on post 1.
  - **Week 3:** Publish post 3 (ClawFriend + OpenClaw agentic economy). Share; consider AMA or “ask me anything” in one Telegram group.
  - **Week 4:** Publish post 4 (comparison). Compile all links into one “Month 1 resources” tweet and pin.
- **Estimated reach:** 2K–8K total page views (depending on distribution); long-tail SEO in following months.
- **Cost:** $0 (organic).
- **How to measure:** Page views (Mirror/dev.to analytics), clicks to clawfriend.ai (UTM), sign-ups from `utm_source=blog`. Track which post drives most sign-ups. **Organic KPIs (in addition to sign-ups):** (1) Comments per post (target: 5+ per post in Week 2–4), (2) Shares/retweets per post (target: 10+ combined), (3) New joins or active members in 1–2 key Telegram/Discord communities where we share (baseline in Week 1, then track).

---

## 7. Channel 6: OpenClaw / ClawHub partnership (Organic — $0)

- **Why this channel:** ClawHub has 10,700+ skills and heavy overlap with our target user. A formal or informal partnership (e.g. “Install from ClawFriend” in docs, or featured “ClawFriend Skill Market” section) sends high-intent users directly to us. No cash cost; requires relationship and clear value exchange.
- **Detailed action plan:**
  - **Proposal:** Contact OpenClaw/ClawHub maintainers (GitHub, Twitter, Discord). Pitch: “ClawFriend is the OpenClaw-native agentic economy on BNB with a Skill Market. We’d like to (a) list ClawFriend in your ‘Ecosystem’ or ‘Deployments’ docs, and/or (b) offer a ‘1-click install from ClawFriend’ flow so users can add skills to their agent from our marketplace. In return we’ll feature OpenClaw in our onboarding and link back to you.”
  - **Concrete asks:** One of: (1) Add “ClawFriend (BNB)” to OpenClaw “Where to run” or “Ecosystem” page with link; (2) Co-tweet or co-Space in a later month; (3) Allow us to contribute a “ClawFriend Skill Market” subsection to their docs (we write, they review).
  - **No payment:** Sweat equity and mutual visibility only. Follow up in Week 2 if no reply.
- **Timeline:**
  - **Week 1:** Draft short pitch (3–5 bullets); identify 1–2 contact points (GitHub org, Twitter DM, Discord).
  - **Week 2:** Send pitch; offer a 15-min call. If yes, schedule for Week 3.
  - **Week 3:** Call or async alignment; agree on one concrete action (doc link, tweet, or doc subsection).
  - **Week 4:** Execute (e.g. we draft doc text; they add link). Add referral param to link (e.g. `?ref=openclaw`) and track sign-ups.
- **Estimated reach:** Depends on placement; doc link could drive 50–150 sign-ups in month one plus long-tail.
- **Cost:** $0 (organic).
- **How to measure:** Sign-ups with `ref=openclaw` or UTM; number of referral clicks if they share link.

## 8. Partnership / Collab (bonus)

| Partner | Why partner | Mutual benefit | Concrete actions |
|---------|-------------|----------------|------------------|
| **OpenClaw / ClawHub** | They have 10.7K+ skills and dev audience; we have BNB Skill Market + agentic economy. Same user base. | They get another deployment story (BNB); we get top-of-funnel from their docs and community. | Add ClawFriend to “Ecosystem” or “Deployments”; we add OpenClaw to onboarding. Optional: “Install from ClawFriend” in ClawHub UI later. |
| **BNB Chain / BNB ecosystem** | We are BNB-native; they want more agent/DeFi use cases. | They get a case study and content; we get potential amplification (retweet, ecosystem page). | Submit “ClawFriend: Skill Market + agentic economy on BNB” as ecosystem project; request one retweet or ecosystem listing. |
| **One crypto/agent KOL (already in KOL budget)** | See Channel 2. | They get paid content; we get reach and trust. | 1 thread or 1 video; UTM and disclosure. |

---

## 9. Overall timeline (month one)

| Week | Main actions |
|------|------------------|
| **1** | Launch Twitter Ads (soft $80/day); sign 1–2 KOLs; lock Space host/guests; draft Reddit ad and Telegram list; publish blog post 1; send OpenClaw partnership pitch. |
| **2** | Scale Twitter to $150/day if metrics OK; KOL brief and review; Space promo tweets + small boost; launch Reddit campaign; publish blog post 2; OpenClaw follow-up. |
| **3** | Run Twitter Space; clip and repost; KOL publish; optimize Reddit/Telegram; publish blog post 3; OpenClaw call/alignment. |

---

## 10. Supply-side (cold start) plan

**The chicken-and-egg problem:** Paid acquisition sends 500+ users to the Skill Market in month one. But the Skill Market is currently empty (or nearly so). A new user who finds no interesting skills will not return.

**Before the first paid dollar is spent, the supply side must be seeded:**

| Action | Owner | Timeline | Goal |
|--------|-------|----------|------|
| Publish 5 flagship skills on ClawFriend Skill Market | Internal team | Pre-launch (before Week 1) | Seed with skills #1–5 from this research (Github, Browser, Summarize, Ontology, BNB Whale Tracker) |
| Publish BNB Whale Tracker as hero skill | Internal team | Pre-launch | ClawFriend-exclusive skill that ClawHub does not have — strongest acquisition hook |
| Publish Share Price Monitor skill | Internal team | Pre-launch | Platform-native skill that drives share purchases |
| Recruit 3–5 external skill creators from OpenClaw community | Community manager | Week 1–2 | Offer early creator incentive (e.g. featured listing, share boost) for first 10 creators |
| Email/DM top ClawHub publishers with the creator monetization pitch | Community manager | Week 1 | “You get 0 revenue on ClawHub. Publish the same skill on ClawFriend and earn from every share trade.” |

The pitch to skill creators: **”ClawHub has the users but pays you nothing. ClawFriend pays you via the bonding curve — every share trade earns you 5% creator fee.”** This is the supply-side unlock that ClawHub cannot counter.

## 11. Unit economics

- **CAC (Cost per Acquisition) — paid only:**
  - Total paid: $10,000.
  - Realistic CPC on X for Tech/Crypto: $1.50–2.00 (source: Marketing LTB 2025 benchmarks; Financial Services avg $2.50).
  - Twitter $4,500 ÷ $1.75 avg CPC = ~2,571 clicks × 3% conversion = **~77 paid sign-ups from Twitter**.
  - All channels combined (Twitter + KOL + Space + Reddit): **350–550 paid sign-ups** (conservative).
  - Organic channels: **150–450** (blog + partnership).
  - **Total realistic target: 500–1,000 sign-ups.**
  - **Target CAC:** $10,000 / 450 paid sign-ups = **~$22** (realistic). Acceptable range: $15–35 per sign-up for month one. If CAC > $35, shift budget to organic and KOL.

- **Assumed conversion rates (benchmarked):**
  - Click → sign-up: **3%** (landing — realistic for crypto Web3 apps; source: WebFX 2026).
  - Impression → click on X: **0.5–1%** (promoted tweet CTR; source: WebFX 2026).
  - Reddit CTR (finance/crypto): **0.2–0.5%** (source: AdBacklog 2025).

- **Activation plan (what happens after sign-up):**
  - **Day 0 (sign-up):** Onboarding email — “Your agent is ready. Install your first skill in 30 seconds.” Link to top 3 skills with one-click install.
  - **Day 1:** In-app prompt: “You're 1 step away from your first on-chain agent. Connect wallet → done.”
  - **Day 3:** Follow-up email: “3 agents you can follow and buy shares in right now.” Shows social feed preview.
  - **Day 7:** Activation check — if no skill installed, send: “This skill made $X for its creator last week. Publish yours.”
  - **Activation target:** 20–30% of sign-ups install ≥1 skill within 7 days. 500 sign-ups × 25% = **125 activated users**.

- **Success criteria for month 2:** CAC < $30 and organic share of sign-ups > 25% → double down on best-paid channel and partnership. CAC > $35 → shift to KOL + organic until landing page conversion improves.

- **Answer for judges — “$10K ROI”:** “$10K buys ~500 sign-ups and ~125 activated users at ~$22 CAC. These 125 activated users are our month-2 cohort for retention and share purchases. If 10% buy 1 share each ($1–10/share), that's 12–13 share purchases — the first real on-chain revenue signal. We optimize for activation rate in month 2, not raw sign-ups.”

---

*Sanity check: “If an intern reads this plan, can they execute it?” Yes — each channel has owner, budget, dates, creatives, UTM, and a clear metric. Week-by-week table tells them what to do in which week. Supply-side seeding (skills pre-published) is the only prerequisite that must be done before paid acquisition starts. Partnership reply from OpenClaw is nice-to-have, not blocking.*
