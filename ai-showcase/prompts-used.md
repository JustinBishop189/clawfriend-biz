## Workflow Summary

```
Participant researches → pastes findings into prompt → AI formats into deliverable → participant verifies numbers
```

1. **Spec onboarding** — summarized the 3,000-word spec to extract key concepts before writing.
2. **Repo scaffolding** — initialized all folders and files from the competition guidebook structure.
3. **Competitive landscape** — participant provided 5-platform table + data; AI wrote full analysis section.
4. **Skill research** — participant provided ClawHub trending list + downloads; AI wrote deliverable.
5. **Distribution plan** — participant provided channel assumptions; AI generated budget table + timeline.
6. **Critical self-assessment** — participant ran independent review against judging rubric; found gaps; AI helped patch them (added ClawHub, Fetch.ai, fixed CPCs, added activation plan).
