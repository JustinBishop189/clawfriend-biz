## 6. Distribution Channel Benchmarks

### 6a. Twitter / X Ads

| Metric | Value | Source | Retrieved |

| Average CPC (all verticals) | $0.50–$2.00 | [WebFX — X marketing benchmarks](https://www.webfx.com/blog/social-media/x-twitter-marketing-benchmarks/) | 2026 |
| Median CPC (Hootsuite 2025 data) | ~$0.18 | [Brafton — social advertising benchmarks](https://www.brafton.com/blog/social-media/social-advertising-benchmarks/) | 2025 |
| CPC for Tech/SaaS vertical | ~$1.75 | [Marketing LTB — Twitter ads statistics](https://marketingltb.com/blog/statistics/twitter-ads-statistics/) | 2025 |
| CPC for Financial Services vertical | ~$2.50 | [Marketing LTB](https://marketingltb.com/blog/statistics/twitter-ads-statistics/) | 2025 |
| Average CPM | ~$5.00 (platform avg) | [WebFX](https://www.webfx.com/blog/social-media/x-twitter-marketing-benchmarks/) | 2026 |
| Crypto/Web3 CPC (Web3 ad networks) | $0.10–$2.00 | [blockchain-ads.com — best Web3 ad networks](https://www.blockchain-ads.com/post/best-web3-ad-networks) | 2026 |
| Average CTR (promoted tweets) | 1%–3% | [Marketing LTB](https://marketingltb.com/blog/statistics/twitter-ads-statistics/) | 2025 |
| Average conversion rate (click→sign-up) | 1%–3% | [WebFX](https://www.webfx.com/blog/social-media/x-twitter-marketing-benchmarks/) | 2026 |

> **Key implication for distribution plan:** The submission assumes CPC of $0.40–0.80. Crypto/Web3 campaigns on X likely fall in the $1.75–$2.50 range (Tech/Financial Services benchmarks). At $1.75 CPC with $4,500 budget → ~2,571 clicks → ~77–154 sign-ups (not 150–400). Consider revising upward to $1.50 CPC as conservative baseline.

### 6b. Reddit Ads

| Micro-KOL | 5K–20K | $100–$500 | [MediaX — crypto influencer costs](https://mediax.agency/blogs/crypto-influencer-marketing-cost) | 2025–2026 |

| Platform avg (all niches, 2026) | — | $155/sponsored post | [Afluencer](https://afluencer.com/influencer-rates/) | 2026 |

> **Key implication:** The distribution plan budgets $2,500 for "1–2 creators with 10K–80K followers." A creator at 80K followers costs $500–$5,000 per post. $2,500 total = either 1 mid-tier creator at the lower end, or 5 micro-KOLs (5K–20K followers). The "50K–150K combined reach" target requires careful KOL selection.
