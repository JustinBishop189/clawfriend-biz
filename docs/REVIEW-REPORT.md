## Deliverable 1: Competitive Landscape (22/25)

### Strengths
- Five competitors with clear head-to-head comparison table
- Concrete metrics (Virtuals: $478M GDP, $13.58B vol; Clanker: $7.62B all-time vol)
- Per-competitor analysis in correct format: doing well/poorly, why users choose, lessons
- Clear, sharp positioning statement at the end
- Data sources stated with date (Feb 24, 2026)

### Areas to improve
- **Only 5 competitors** — guidebook asks for 5–10; adding 1–2 more would strengthen (suggestions: Fetch.ai, SingularityNET, or another Web3 skill marketplace)
- **Clawnch** — metrics mostly “not public”; weaker vs other competitors
- Some figures have a “should be re-verified” disclaimer — judges may ask about accuracy

### Suggestion
> Add at least one more competitor with public metrics to firmly meet “5–10” and prepare to cite primary sources for every number.

**Status:** Addressed by adding SingularityNET as 6th competitor in `competitive-landscape.md`.

## Deliverable 2: Skill Research (21/25)

### Strengths
- **8 skills** — meets 5–10 requirement; good mix (dev, web, memory, crypto, social)
- Concrete demand evidence: ClawHub download numbers (23k–35k) with source
- Correct format: target user, problem, alternative, how it solves, visibility & monetization
- Security warning for crypto skills — professional and shows ecosystem awareness
- “Honorable mentions” section is a plus

### Areas to improve
- **Bankr and Privy** — demand evidence weaker (“discussed in threads”) vs skills with clear download numbers
- **Visibility & Monetization** — “private/holder-gated” still vague; judges may ask for concrete pricing (e.g. how many shares to unlock?)
- **Gog (~34.8k downloads, #1)** is only in “Honorable mentions” instead of main list — can seem inconsistent

### Suggestion
> Prepare an answer for: *“Why is Gog not in the main list but Bankr/Privy are?”* — e.g. we prioritize Web3-native skills for ClawFriend positioning.

**Status:** Addressed by adding “Why Gog is Honorable Mention” and concrete visibility (e.g. share threshold) in `skill-research.md`.

## Deliverable 3: Distribution Plan (35/40)

### Strengths
- **6 channels** — above 3–5 requirement; mix of organic and paid
- Clear budget breakdown; total exactly $10,000
- Week-by-week timeline for each channel
- Full UTM tracking — executable by an intern
- Unit economics with CAC target (~$16.67) and clear conversion assumptions
- Sanity check at the end — aligned with judges’ expectations
- Partnership bonus with 3 columns (partner, mutual benefit, actions)

### Areas to improve
- **Twitter Ads = $4,500/10,000 (45%)** — quite concentrated; judges may ask *“What if Twitter Ads underperforms?”* — need a clearer contingency
- **Reddit/Telegram $1,500** — less detail on Telegram vs Reddit; “Option A/B” without a clear commitment
- **Organic channels** — no concrete KPIs for comments, shares, or community size; only page views and sign-ups
- **Presentation link** in README still placeholder — missing before present = point deduction

### Suggestion
> Prepare an answer for: *“What is the ROI of your $10K?”* — you have numbers (~600 sign-ups, CAC ~$16.67); add LTV or next step after sign-up (e.g. activation, first skill download).

**Status:** Addressed by adding contingency plan, Telegram detail, organic KPIs, and $10K ROI / LTV note in `distribution-plan.md`.
